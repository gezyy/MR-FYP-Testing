# User Manual

Welcome to IMREG. Here’s how to deploy this project locally:

## 1. Download and Unzip the Project
Download the `.zip` file and unzip it to your local disk. It is recommended to unzip it to a hard drive for faster project loading.

## 2. Open the Project in Unity
After unzipping, open the folder’s root directory using Unity Hub. Make sure the version of Unity Editor on your local machine matches the version of this project, which is **2022.3.13f1c1**, or a higher version. However, it is recommended to use a version from the **2022.3** series to avoid any potential incompatibility with plugins and scripts.

## 3. Connect Meta Oculus Quest 3 Device
While waiting for the project to open, connect your **Meta Oculus Quest 3** device to your PC using the official USB cable, and then launch the **Meta Quest Link** software (if you have already downloaded and logged in to the account on your computer, it will usually launch automatically).

## 4. Select Your PC in Quest Link
Then, put on your headset, go to **Settings > Quest Link**, and select your PC. The device will automatically connect to your PC.

## 5. Launch the Project
At this point, you should be able to see your computer desktop inside the headset. Congratulations, now you just need to click the **"Run"** button in the Unity Editor to launch the project.

## 6. Scan the Room and Create Furniture
Note that you need to use your headset to scan the room and create the furniture you need to add, as the project requires your spatial data to recognize the surrounding space.

## 7. First-Time User Instructions
If this is your first time using the Meta Oculus Quest 3 device, make sure you follow the tutorial that comes with the headset to learn the basic controller and gesture interactions. The game also includes the necessary in-game guidance for the operations and tasks required to complete the game. Just make sure to watch all the in-game guidance videos before proceeding, and you should have no problems.

## Potential Issues and Solutions:

### 1. Room Data Error
If your project keeps showing errors and cannot receive room data, and if you have just scanned the room, it could be because you have HTC VIVE drivers installed on your PC. You will need to completely uninstall those drivers and then run the project again.

### 2. Wi-Fi Connectivity Issue
It is not recommended to use Wi-Fi to connect the headset and PC, as the instability of Wi-Fi may cause data transmission interruptions.
